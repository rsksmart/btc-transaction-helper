# btc-transaction-helper

Utility library to generate BTC addresses (legacy, segwit and multisig) and its BTC private key and execute transfers.
## Running samples

> node samples/rpc-commands.js

> node samples/transferBtc-samples.js

> node samples/import-address.js

> node samples/conversion.js
 
**Note:** These samples require a running bitcoin instance to connect to. Each file contains the configuration that should be updated to point to the running bitcoin instance (except for 'conversion').
